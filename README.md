# pyskillswitch
Block all screens at will

# Information
This is similar to [screenlock](https://github.com/ios7jbpro/screenlock), except this uses a keyboard shortcut and locks ALL screens out.

You can change the password in the .py file, along with the shortcut.

# But... why? Windows has a lock shortcut?
Because IT'S SO SLOW WHEN IT COMES TO SHOWING ITSELF UP so this is a band-aid alternative if you need to instantly hide your content from being viewed
